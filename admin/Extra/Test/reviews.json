   "Review": "Arronofsky has very skillfully exposed how vulnerable we are when our privacy is exploited.  But this movie is much more than that. If you're a bit into christian mythology and enjoy having symbolism into your movies, this is the one! I strongly suggest you to read about the movie after it ends and read what it meant. I may go as far as to suggest that this movie lies in the bracket of movies like Fight Club; which received negative reviews upon it's release but after some time is regarded as the modern greats.",

   "Review": "I'm not generally into fantasy movies and especially if it is a love story. But this has completely blown my mind. The story is not that complicated; rather easy to decipher but the way it was executed, the acting is just exceptional.  Del Toro has portrayed the female emotions in a masterful manner and has set the benchmark for the fantasy genre. If you want to watch a heart-warming film which doesn't overdoses on the 'cheesy elements' (unlike other fantasies) and captivates you from start to end, this is the one for you.",

A boy wants to become a great drummer and his teacher helps him to become one. Simple right? But it didn't get the best academy award for motion picture for nothing. If it doesn't inspire you, nothing can. The cinematography (apart from the acting) is just stunning considering there was no scope for a grandious wide scope shots that generally get the praises. How Chazelle got to make academy winning film from such a simple script is just mind boggling. ",

   "Review": "This movie lies amongst the most influential movies of all times. Almost like the Interstellar of 1970s! The manner in which Kubrick has made this film taking into consideration what technologies he had to work with at that time is simply unbelievable. And as far as story goes, if you're not a fan of symbolism within the movie, I wouldn't particularly recommend this, as Kubrick has kept the movie open-ended and there are quite a few stretches where there would be no dialogue or background score and it would seem that the movie has come to a halt. But once you see the movie and research a bit about it,  you'll never believe what hit you, as the bigger picture this movie portrays answers one of the greatest intellectual questions of all time - where do we come from and where are we going?",

And by that, I don't mean to only point towards the plot, but also towards the way it was executed. It is more of a stylistic movie than your regular ones. The way the dialogoues are delivered isn't just plain old english but rather seems as if poetry is rolling off from actors mouth. the cinematography is phenomenal and it reaches just the perfect amount of abstractness - not too much to be considered crazy and not too little to be seen as a long shot. Trust me, if you want to have a feel of what Kubrick represents, this is the movie that you should be watching.",

Aronofsky is know to mess with deepest of human desires and this movie is no exception.

No wonder Aronofsky took inspiration from this movie to shoot some of the scenes in Requime for a dream to showcase a mentally broken character. A true psycho thriller in making. Make sure to keep a keen eye on the story as it takes a lot of twists and turns. And also one more thing, unlike some of the anime movies out there, this one is very dark showing gratuitous rape scenes, violent and gore murders. It isn't very easy on the eyes. But make no mistake as all these elemnents aren't without a cause and definitely leads upto the climax. Looking for a thriller movie night and popcorn, this is right up your ally!",

But although having the advantage of having an animeic medium for story telling, it couldn't get the polt across as easily as the directors would've wanted. But Nolan has executed it to perfection!

But that's what makes it such a fun to watch as we go on a hilarious yet heart warming journey with Forrest Gump. Apart from that, it has a lot of easter eggs spread evenly which openly mocks some of the infamous moments of the 60s. Keep an eye out for them!

Nothing more can be said about the acting by Natalie Portman (who recieved an oscar for it) and the intelligent cinematography which very skillfully the blurring of reality of our protagonist. If you are looking for some inspiration with a dash of psychotic elements, this is right up your alley! ",

   "Review": "Ah, finally we get to the most reprised role of all - the Joker! Todd Philips has portrayed his joker as the mentally unstable one who gradually finds solace within madness and eventually becomes a psycopath (not explicitely shown in the movie) but one can guess as this definitely isn't the anarchist that Nolan portrayed. So don't watch this film with the expectation of a criminal mastermind of a joker or else you would be disappointed. But rather watch it for the amazing cinematography, the awe-inspiring acting, the perfect dark setting. The storyline isn't much groundbreaking but for showing the origins of joker, it can't get better than this. One can only hope to see the deious schemes that the Joker is associated with would become evident with the upcoming movies but as a base for that, this definitely hits the home run!",

It was only 6-7 years later that people can to realize how powerful it actually is! Granted, at the strat, it feels very abstract, the dialogue delivery isn't very staright forward and you sometimes feel lost. But the twist that it provides at the end set the basis of many psycological films for years to come! It maintains a very fine speed of story so you won't feel bored at any time. Trust me, if you are bored watching the films with similiar template of hero-villain-climax, then this movie will completely blow your mind!",

It is one of those terms which could , depending on your day , be an entity , a security or just a sense of compassionate belonging with someone . Hirokazu Koreeda's Palme d'Or winning Japanese \"family\" drama continuously asks this question and in twisted but inherently human fashion , in the final quarter of the film puts forward its own take on those philosophical questions . Through candidly beautiful cinematography , Shoplifters tells its simple yet cathartic story , showing us around lives of chaos albeit through the lens of calmness , never getting heavy for any kind of viewer . Either you need a light hearted movie to unburden your head , or a deeply metaphysical exploration of something we can all relate to , this is a must-watch movie depending on how you decide to watch it .",

   "Review": "Humans deal with death in quite a unique way as it is always a blend of anger, grief and feeling astray. No movie portrays this emotion as powerfully and in it's purest form by Three Billboards. A mom is out for justice for her daughter who was brutally raped and left for dead. Based on a true story, it shows complex character dynamics as the protagonist walks the thin line between retribution and precise justice. Now, let me warn you, this movie does not provide closure, so you fill a bit wanting at the end. But the amazing acting, and the cathartic changes that affect every character provides a lot of depth to fulfill this gap. Believe me, this is a movie which you don not want to miss out on to.",

The template might seem a bit uncommon what differentiates it from the rest is the beautiful use of sybolism within the movie coupled with some of the best acting you can find theese days! The film very craftfully uses wide angle scenes to give a feel of looking at a portrait rather than a movie. An excellent dramatic storyline with a bit dark, yet beautiful ending. Also, it is set chapterwise so it does give off a vibe of reading a grand novel. Simply marvelous.

There's no stylistic elemnts associated with it. But Spotlight forces you to think otherwise. The intensity with which everything is shown is allows one to truly connect with the movie. What makes this so great is that unlike other true-story-based-movies, is that it does not manipulate the script in any manner to make it more appealing to the general population. Rather the rawness and directness is what makes this so good to watch. So if you feel like watching a movie about initiated people against a poweful organisation, this should top your list.",

Stanley Kubrick's Dr strangelove is black and white in illustration yet as colorful as they come in its storytelling and is his funniest and most satirical , and one of his absolute best . Kubrick continues to be a director with movies thst are hard to classify under a single \"genre\" tag . Dr strangelove is not your typical satire movie either. It will psych you in on its false sense of seriousness in the beginning , eventually melting away the layers , revealing the bone tingling acid-trip of the satire underneath , just to pull a rug from under your feet in the end , forcing you to think what exactly was it that you saw . If you do not consider watching a black and white movie for 1.5 hrs as a waste of your time , this movie will make you laugh and also make you think . On second thoughts , even if you do , watch it and decide for yourself .",

Gustave and his protege Zero who have been falsely accused of murder. It's a simple concept, nothing too extravagent. But what makes this such a breathtaking movie is that it does not have a story; rather has a fairy tale! Wes Anderson has purposefully directed it in a square frame with zero use of CGI to make it as fantastical as possible. Each frame looks like something out of a painter's canvas and this attributes to such a fresh breather to what we are usually accustomed to see! If you aren't impressed by the eye-candy of cinematography or the impeccable setting or the magnificent background score, fret not! This movie is all about the mockery of the tyrannous rule of the Czars of eastern Europe in turn portraying it's horror as mischievous and frivolous charm (sometimes almost child-like!) for which you would long to come back for more.",

Note this is in no way a Lolita-esque senario but rather of how a man having such a low self esteem and hatered for himself starts dreaming again and gets free form years of emotional paralysis. It plays with conundrum of a man having impure thoughts even tho he knows are morally wrong and yet can't help it as he's been wired like that.

There's a bit of mystery element and is laid with wonderfully funny sequences. It's 2 hours of pure joy after which you can't help but love 'The Dude' and his pals.

But oh man have I ever not regretted that decision! It is thoroughly charming, gently comic; this is the story of a boy and a girl whose body get's exchanged and their tale of trying to meet each other. But fate has other plans. It is wonderfully executed. Each scene comes across as something out of an art gallery! The fact that it is the highest grossing anime film yet is attributed to impeccable story writing which leaves you emotionally satisfied. A bit of a mindbender too which gives the viewer a breather from the romance in it. When the tipping point in story comes, it will bowl you over (like you've been struck by a meteor!) and by the end, it is garunteed to leave a smile on your face and tears in your eyes. ",

Started of well, provided an amazing turn in the middle and was on it's way to achieve a masterclass climax. The setting is done like nothing ever seen before! The perfect mix of 17th century old Japan with roots to the British empire. There's a generous amount of nudity and eroticism within the movie (so yeah definitely not a family movie!). The errie soundtrack with an almost perfect storyline shoots this almost to the heights of Parasite (another masterpiece from the Korean Cinema). The movie creates the perfect sense of suspense and had it not been for a bit predictable ending (coupled with some unnecessarily long erotic sequences) this movie would've been on a whole different level. But it wasn't selected for the Palme D'Or for nothing! The movie will keep you in a hold for a majority of time, so if you want to watch a thriller suspense with backdrop like that of The Favourite, this one should just do it.",

   "Review": "A powerhouse of a film. The reason this movie went under the radar of many despite the star power of Margot Robbie would be because of potentially portraying Tonya Harding, a controversial figure herself in a light which many might not agree with. But simply no one can take away the absolute peach of acting by Margot. Looking back at this movie, no one comes to mind who could better project a strong, rough red neck who despite having her life riddled with abuse continue to keep up her bravado and march on. The scene where she tries to put a smile on her face despite having an immense desire to cry is enough to make Joaquin Pheonix proud! That is the level of acting we are talking. If you know the actual controversy surrounding Tonya Harding, this movie won't provide much of an insight, but if not, this seems like a good place to dip your feet into one of the shocking moments of figure skating.",

   "Review": "What an acid trip of a movie this is! As it is typical of David Lynch's movies the story starts without any fuss or giving any time to settle and often relies on the viewer to piece ones and twos together rather than explain it explicitly. But they manner the script completely flips by the end seems almost there are two stories going on in the movie! It shows how easy it is to loose your mind in the challenging environment of hollywood. It is the stuff dreams and dillusion are made of and is the movie which we are trying to decipher to this date even! I would like to say here that Lynch tried to pull off what Kubrick did with 2001; leving the story open-ended. Although he did not reach the same level as Kubrick's masterpiece did in that manner, I would still say, he did one hell of a job. I strongly suggest people to read more about it's ending once you've seen it as it definitely ain't easy to get it all in one go. But once you do, man-oh-man, your mind would blow apart and slowly realize what a masterpiece from Lynch this is!",

   "Review": "Ah, Wes Anderson and his warm and poignant movies full of his idiosyncratic views are always a fun to watch. As his trademark this movie too is something out of a child's story book. There are wide angle shots with almost no sudden cuts, often ridiculous use of CGI (knowingly so as to emphasise the feel of watching a fantasy story unfold!) with the characters being innocent and whimsical. The movie starts with a shade of The Blue Lagoon to it's tail and feels a bit cheeky. But it wears you down slowly to the point that you would feel dissapointed that it ends as it offers an escape from your regular movies. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is at the level of The Grand Budapest Hotel (that was one-in-a-million movie) but you could certainly see how this movie proved to be the penultimate step towards horning his cinematic skills for THAT masterpiece. All-in-all, don't give this movie too much thought, just sit back, relax and let Wes take you on a journey to the fairy tale land.",

As with his previous films, Adaptation and The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I had the uneasy feeling that one single idea was being extruded to an excessive length, but this movie's crazy emotional intensity and ambition really punched my lights out. For his directorial debut, the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has outdone himself, for good. Truly a master piece, with motifs hidden in dialogues that blow your mind, yet seem so familiar. The film itself seems to be alive and adapting (and it is!), just like human life. It's an experience of someone’s (everyone’s) thoughts, misery, views like never before. Obviously a must watch.",

   "Review": "It feels almost sureal that a movie which was directed almost 50 years ago about a court room drama still resonates as on of the finest films of the 20th century. It features how 12 jurors are tasked with giving the final verdict on whether a boy is guilty or not after looking at the evidence. The case seema fairly straight forward but one of them feels that they aren't looking at it closely. What follows is his efforts to look at the case objectively and eventually convinece the other 11 men the other way around. The filming takes completely in one room which makes it very hard for the director to not make the film feel static or even induce a feeling of claustrophobia within the viewers. Each of 12 men were associated with a distinct traight who preformed to the level that it makes the movie feel not just a discussion with 12 average Joes even though their background was such! Overall, if you can get over the fact that it's a BnW film, I suggest you do give it a watch. On other hand, even if you aren't, do watch it. Rotten Tomatoes haven't given it a 100% rating for nothing!",

   "Review": "Set in the early 20th century, this is a movie of two men who are stuck at a lighthouse island and their gradual descent into madness. Robert Eggers very clearly flexes his impeccable sense of direction here. It creates an eerie sense of unsettling while keeping you drawn to the fantastic setting. What boosts this prospect is that the movie is shot in square frame and is in BnW. As all greate psychological thrillers, this too has a quite bit of symbolism which like I suggest in my previous reviews encourage you to read more about the movie after it ends to actually feel the message that the story writer wanted to send across. But what truely makes this a masterpiece is the oscar worthy acting by both Williem Defoe and Robert Pattinson (who may have have proved his mettle as an actor with this movie). They could easily have won an oscar (Defoe should've gotten for supporting actor imo) had it not been for a certain Joker. Overall this is powerfull watch which would dazzle you with it's acting, setting and symbolism rather than the story itself. Reserve it for those cold winter evenings and watch as it acts out the insanities and depravities of man when forced into isolation (hey!).",

Everything is perfect about this movie. The setting - The Overlook during the winters, with it's narrow corridors and hypnotising carpets, check. Creepy side characters - the twins, naked old lady, check. And the acting - oh man, I don't think this movie would've got even half the recognition it gets had it not been the terrific acting by Jack Nicolson. The perfect level of insanity has been displayed by Nicolson with emphasis on each and every muscles of the face! The bar scene is enough to school some of the greats today! The Shining has set the benchmark for all psychological thrillers to come. But if you really want to take a feel of the story, I suggest you read the book (the film no doubt stands strong in it's own rights but still couldn't capture the true insanity that Jack Torrence faced as well as the book did). This movie has to be on your watch-before-you-die list!",

Yet this movie stands out tall and strong. Led by the powerful starcast of Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce, it is the story of a dialogue discussion between a pope and a Cardinal with differing world views and how they reach to a conclusion. It won't provide you with any logical persuasion to watch it till the end, but the calm manner in which it has been depicted makes you almost float towards the end. It is a lighthearted drama which you could watch without having to put much of a thought into it. Not a must watch, but if you have a desire to watch something different, this could hit the palette just right!",

I myself felt that Zack Snyder has done 100% justice to this movie by incorporating each and every element that's there in the comic and brought it to the movie. But that's what I felt prevented it from reaching the heights the movie was supposed to with such a spectacular story as one simply can't bring out the beauty that the comic exudes with its charm onto a screen. But Snyder gets full credits for it's execution. This movie may not have the best ratings but I've still included it here as a homage to the actual Watchmen comic book which was far ahead of it's time and is quite accurately regarded as the greatest comic ever written. So yeah, this one is more of a promotion for the comic book rather than the movie! But once you've read it, this movie is definitely a lot of fun to watch!",

Surgically precise, we come to experience top drawer acting  from Ben Affleck and of course, the lead Rosamund Pike. This psychological thriller drama has everything in it as we come to expect from a psycho thriller - a bit bent character (very craft fully played as the estranged wife of Nick Dune (Ben Affleck) by Rosamund Pike), a guersome murder of an innocent bystander to spice things up, the often comical and hypocritical portrayal of the society to set the eerie environment. And of course, as is a trademark of all Fincher's movies- an ending without a closure often leaving you hanging but with a sense of high! Fincher has set the benchmark for psycho thriller out there and it seems unlikely that anyone would surpass it any time soon.",

This is a belarussian film set in the 1980s where an aspiring DJ plans to go to US to escape her boring routine and do something she actually likes. But a small typo in her visa application creates problems and she has to go some distance (literally!) to ensure that everything functions smoothly. A pretty straight-forward plot. But what makes this an exquisite watch is that the director has absolutely nailed in showcasing the hoplessness and desperation in one's eyes when he/she senses an oportunity of a better life which seems to slipping from their grasp. As a foreign viewer, it totally bowls you over giving insight into the daily lives of the smaller towns in the eastern block of Europe. And credit where it is deserved- the acting by the lead actress is phenomenal and she totally encapsules what the director wanted to showcase. Despite this tremendous performance, it still surprises me why is she so unknown! But all in all this is a must watch film and I don't throw that word around lightly! The specialty about this is that it proves that the mundanity of everyday life can provide a remedy to the everyday wretchedness. Simply stunning.",

What differentiates this movie from other typical horror genere is that it actually has a credibe storyline and not just a random family moving into a haunted house with no care. Aster very skillfully inducts human emotions such as grief, trauma, yearning for normalancy with the horror elements which gives it a nice human touch thus making it more believeable. Of course the horror portion has got the perfect mix of jumpscares, gore and mind benders. Not only the setting to the story is well written, but the complete story written is very well explained inturn adding a genre of thriller/suspense to the movie as well. The gore mind you may seem a bit much to some viewers but it all adds to the setting and not just for the 'kick'.

   "Review": "If the quote- 'It's the journey and not the destination that matters' is adjoined to a movie, this one might be it. It is about a teenage dutch girl who sets out on a journey in Bosina (her hometown but had to flee due to war) to find her father who's been terminally ill. Accompanying her are her cousin and his accquiantance. Not your essential road-trip movie, but it provides a youthful perspective to matters. The beauty here lies more in the complex dynamics between the 3 rather than the story itself. But the main selling point for me here is the magnificant cinematography- use of soft yet vivid colours, shooting in tight angles so as to just capture the essence, the 4:3 aspect ratio really adds to the setting. Also, the film does not feature any pan shots and has very few instances of having a background score- thus giving it a realistic feel. All-in-all, this dutch movie might not be for everyone, but it certainly provides a fresh outlook on the genre of movies whose center focus is travel/",

   "Review": "A tour-de-force of a film this is! Making a war film always requires a humongous budget because of the sheer size, special effects and a pelothra of side actors. Not to mention the amount of time and work it must take to make it as realistic as possible. And 1917 comes as close to realism as any war movie possibly can! It portrays the life in the trenches during WW1 and the risks and hazards that the soldier must undertake. It has been made as a single shot movie (and thus commands greater respect as to how could Sam mendes possible shoot scenes in such narrow trenches!) The film also has beautiful instances of humanity and takes necessary pauses whereever required. The detailing is immaculate and really transports you to that erra and the cinematography makes you resonates with what the soldiers are feeling mentally. This is a must watch movie for the war-movie enthusiats out there!",

The movie starts creating a sense of errieness and continuously gives off unsettling vibes. In the majority of the movie everyone's smilling but there's a constant sense of impending doom. The acting by Daniel Kaayula is just spectacular and at no point would you ever want to leave your seat! What makes this such a spectacular psychological horror is that this movie won't mess around with your brain. The clues are wide open for all to see. The thrill here would rather be the greater picture that these clues point to. It invovles Chris who has been invited to he girlfirend's parent's house for a party but slowly discovers there's a far sinister purpose to his visit. Even if you are a fan of horror/thriller or not, this is a must watch!",

   "Review": "This movie at times feels like is directed by Wes Anderson. Although there's no wide angle shots or audacious use of CGI, there seems to be a similiar satirical view to how the story develops. It starts with the kind of innocent comedy that's often portrayed in child's book. It takes a dark turn midway giving a reminiscent of The Boy in the Stripped Pyjamas but almost seamlessly transitions back to a warm ending giving a sense of closure. Viewing this movie in a child's perspective movie would give you a better sense of the film as only then would one go into the mind of a 10 years old Nazi fanatic. The best part of this film is that it never crosses the line between being a warm, feel-good movie and being a cheesy movie. The movie absolutely mocks the Nazi regiment while showing the colours of friendship and hope and joy during those dull times. Overall, this movie won't stirr up anything within you, but will certainly leave you with a smile on your face.",

   "Review": "An Austrian psychological horror movie which might be for every horror movie fan out there. It's a bit slow in the first half and small scare when compared to what we've seen in Hereditry or Midsommar. But the slow buildup certainly pays dividends as the twist is worth every second spent! The errie setting with virtually no background score creates a perfect unsetteling setting. There are a few scenes which might suggest it will lead upto the typical jumpscare based horror with demon/ghost as the driving force. There's almost no way one could guess what twist the ending would bring as the transitions are so subtle it almost feels artistic! Few scenes makes you wanna look away but there's something strange about the way it compels you to keep on watching! Overall, this is a must watch for psychological-horror fans out there. Certainly a complelling movie with a near perfect ending!",

   "Review": "If you thought that 2001: a space odessey was a mind bender, you won't even know what hit you in this movie! It's a completely meta film with tons of symbolism. It follows the life of Henry, who's on 'vacation' and is out of the blue tasked by his ex-girlfriend's mom to marry her daughter and take care of the hideously looking baby. What ensures is Henry completely loosing his mind and a hold of reality. Lynch has tried to literally showcase what a nighmare feels like. The setting is completely nightmarish (remember this word as a lot of clues are in itself) where everything is there where it supposed to be... and still seems out of place! There's no storyline, rather a compelling journey into Henry's mind. The environment is horrifying, yet has a beautiful undertone to it. There's silence to many sequences but an unnerving feel to it. Trust me if you're not a fan of meta movies, you would think of this movie as a complete waste of time. But if you look at the movie; not as a viewer but as Henry himself and pick up the subtle clues, this is according to me, the finest movie by David Lynch. First time you watch,  you will dismiss it as a nonsensical movie. But it will hold onto you, even after you watch it. compelling you to think hard about it. And once you figure out the secret key, not only will you laud David Lynch to direct this masterpiece as his debut film, but would realize how far ahead of it's time was this movie!",

The story revolves around our beloved tramp, who struggles to find his feet in a city, where jobs are scare due to the rise of automation (sounds familiar?) but yet manages to find the beauty in it. Even though slapstick comedy is a thing of the past, this one still manages to make you laugh to this date because it is not just meaningless humor, but rather is a sharp attack and a mockery of the workings of the society itself. This movie's nomination here is thus more of a tribute to Charlie Chaplin himself, but the movie in itself has earned the righ to be recognized even without it's prodigious creator. That's the power and weight it holds.",

The expectations were sky high and the trailer/teaser looked very very promising. But I felt maybe that's what might have prevented me from enjoying this movie. What Peel aimed to invigorate within his viewers was the sense of humbleness by leaving you unsusre about your place within the universe; but it rather left left us a bit wanting and a confused feeling without any closure. The base story was extremely good and the acting by a few of the characters genuinely made us feel unsettled.  While I felt the ending could have been navigated in a manner which would leave us hanging as well as have a decent closure. But this would be one of those movies which I would suggest not to take my word on it as it has a huge fan base within the critics as well as the average viewers. So I rather leave it up to you to watch it and decide it for yourself.",

And no I am not talking about the ScarJo adaptation but rather the good old Anime movie from 1995. And I'll be a bit biased here as I am a huge cyberpunk fan. This movie has such a legendry status amongst the world of 'anime-films' is because of two reasosn. Firstly is the manner in which the creators had planned the ladscape in such a detailed and beautiful manner that it is impossible for anyone not to like it! Every scene in this film is wallpaper worthy. And the secod reason being that the storyline was so ahead of it's time - mixing advanced AI with crime and also questioning the very conscious of oneself; is the first time it was introduced to cinema. A theme which may now seem a bit run down but at that time was just mind-boggling and all the related stoylines we see now has in some form or the other drawn inspiration from this. If you are an anime fan, this should be on your watchlist. Simply marvelous.",

It follows a game o cat and mouse between a war veteren and a psychotic killer (played to near perfection by Javier Bardem, who should get a lot more recognition for this role). It represents the Coen brothers at the peak of their powers. The raw wild-west backdrop of New Mexico with delicate shots and quite cleverly not using background score for action sequences gives this movie a more human feel (and hence the rawness). But it is not just mindless chase sequences. We also see polarizing characters which the Coen brothers have used many elements to give them a more three dimensional characters thus giving them depth and more meaning to their involvment with the story. Also, the storyline does not have your typical hero outsmarting the villain backdrop. Rather both seem equally formidable and equally weak thereby making them as realistic as possible. So to conclude, if I would have to describe this movie in one word, that would be (and you might've guessed by now) - raw. A must watch.",

It showcases the nightmarish world of modern warfare from both the innocent civilians and the terrorist's perspective. It also dewels into the mindset of the soldiers who have seen and taken part in the attrocities of war, and how that eventually affects thier life and their loved ones. Fantastic cinematography coupled with engaging direction proves to show that movies with such serious undertone also have the caliber to be entertaining. The background score also is very skillfully set so as to create the tense environment required.

So far as the storyline is concerd, it may not rank amongst the top 10 con movies, but it certainly provides a bang for a buck in terms of literal entertainment value. What makes it different from the usual con films is that it uses human relations not as a plot in itself, but rather an independent entity giving it a more human approach.

There was no doubt that a Bond film would earn it's spot on this list sooner or later. The question was, which one? Answer - Casino Royale. It starts off with arguably the best chase sequence you are ever going to see and follows from that in a very sequential manner. The whole plot (unlike the trademark of Bond films) is actually very realistic which adds to the thrill. Daniel Craig (in my opinion) takes away the bearth as the best actor to be casted as Bond. The whole plot is very gripping and paves way for a more humane bond with feelings rather than the sterotypical ones that were portrayed before. There's not much to say about this really and I am sure most of the people have already watched this movie. But this one still remains as one of the best Bond films ever.",

   "Review": "Ah, probably one of the most celebrated horror films out there. Movie when you see it now doesn't provide that much of a kick when you expect to watch a horror-thriller and in many ways feels quite slow to be honest. But one must also take into consideration that this movie was released in 1960 during which the everyday life was vastly different. The slowness of the movie is a result of how laid back life was back then as compared to today. And plus the horror elements were awefully rudimentry as what we have today. But this movie deserves a special mention in this coulmns as prior to this, all movies with the horror tag always involved ghosts or demons. This was probably the first successful horror film that used more of it's settings and the psychological elements of a thriller genre than the typically associated tropes. It is the one which paved the way for the 'psycho-thrillers' such as Get Out. You probably would get bored watching this (although the story certainly is very finely written), but had it not been for this movie, the horror genre would still be just ghosts running around in white bedcloth.",

   "Review": "The french cinema has over the years given us some realy gruesome movies. Adding to that list is the 2017 film Raw. It is about sophmore college girl who's family is a strict vegetarian but develops a tast for human flesh. Sounds blood curling, right? The story doesn't dwell much on how she deals with it, but rather showcases how it affects those around her. The imagery is highly vivid so do watch with a bit caution. There are not many twists (except the one at the end which brings everything to a circle). It feels like a comming of age movie turned into a true classy nightmare (somewhat on the lines of Stephen King's Carrie). There's not much logic to it, so you can just kickback and watch as the horror unfolds. I personally felt that the concept reaaly is marvelous but the directors could have added a bit more spice to it. Overall, a good movie to watch with friends, but make sure not it around dinner or lunch time!",

   "Review": "Probably the finest movie of the past decade that has come out of Bollywood. With a few hints of 'The Godfather', Anurag Kashyap has created a masterpeice that Tarantino would be proud of. It is unbashed, unapologetic and brings out the bloody feud of two communities which streatches over generations with moments of poetic seriousness. He has very skillfully (perhaps the best I have ever seen) used numerous sound tracks and background scores to generate the mood and the setting. The characters have a rich depth to them and their each attribute contributes to the storyline rather than just provide a vessel for occassional relief from the film's serious tones. This is story telling at it's best. The script doesn't waste time on romantic frivolities (unless it tells something unique about the character) but at the sametime provides a healthy detour from the main storyline which in itself reveals more about the characters themselves! Fantastic story, fantastic character portrayal; this is a must watch.",

The movie is very well written and the actors- Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl have played their part to perfection. The cinematography isawe-inspiring and combined with the best soundtrack of Hans Zimmer ever (yes, I repeat the best ever soundtrack), the movie generates the same thrill as sitting in the cockpit of a f1 car!

Unlike most of the movies involving aliens, this one actually makes you believe that in case such calamity ever happened, the actions dipicted in this movie would be the most probable way to deal with it. This movie combines many elements - sci-fi (of course), love and motherhood, history (mostly concerning language) and time! the arrival of alien here is mainly a prop that is used here. The visuals are stunning and the aspects that are often taken for granted when making a sci-fi movie has been kept to a minimal making it all the more real. Although it did not fare as well at the box office as it should have, I believe should be given greater recognition as this movie has shown that making a sci-fi movie need not require use of over the top tropes or wishfull thinking, but rather a unique perspective into daily matters suffics as well. The pace is great, no loitering around the curb-side stories but a gentle dip into the protagonist's personal life gives way for a marvellous climax!",

Inorder to get you in the correct mood for the movie, it will start slowly and casually, catching you off gaurd. It will then turn up the heat as your heart oscillates in rythm to the calm and cool collective of Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) and the fiery temprament of Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman). The latter's daughter has gone missing and he will do whatever it takes to get her back. Although this motive seems like an overused template, Prisoners actually gives the viewer an option to choose which character to use while solving the mystery (which by the way is as good as it gets!). The climax and the journey to it is definitely worth every second. Reserve this for those late saturday night movie times. ",

   "Review": "Kubrick brings us another masterpiece to us in the form of a war movie - Full Metal Jacket. Narrated more as a second person documentry than a movie, FMJ revolves around the life of Pvt. Joker who walks us through the horrors of war. The horror here is not the vivid imagery of bloodshed or anything but rather the psychological effect that a war has (as seen clearly by the turn around of Pvt. Pyle). This movie doesn't have a proper storyline as it is devoid of any motives or drives, so I wouldn't recommend this one on a blockbuster night. But if want to watch something raw and unfiltered, then this one fits the bill. Much of the movie is mainly political discussions and a black irony of the treatment that the soldiers get during their training and the one that they impose upon their enemies. Save this one for those times when you feel intellectually inspired!",

Even if you are not, it is just impossible not to appreciate the beauty in every frame. Clearly a class apart in that category. I definitely urge you to watch its predecessor, as it will lay a more clear foundation. In terms of storyline, not one of the best sci-fi written and a personal opinion- the original Blade runner released in 1982 was a tad bit better. Nevertheless this is one of those few outliers that I would suggest to watch it for the visuals rather than for the story. Nevertheless, this should diminish the well wriiten narrative puzzle that Villeneuve has given us. ",

This 1962 film is appreciated for two things - one, is the magnitude of production this movie required (not at the level of Cleopetra but still pretty huge considered to the standards in 1960s) and second is thw wonderfull manner in which the director has steered this story to make it as accurate as possible (considering its validity is still up in air!) and at the same time making it hugely entertaining.

Tom Hanks is no stranger to acting in survival themed movies (read Cast Away) but the one that took away the podium is Barkhad Abdi who deservedly earned his Oscar nomination. The story is gripping and engaging (the true story itself is quite interesting).

It allows us a peek into the life of three friends from different ethenic backgrounds who see the law and police as oppressors and blame them as the root cause of their anger, frustration and rage. La Haine does not offer any soutions to the problems dipicted here. Rather it shows the fructration of the characters who feel trapped by their circumstances.

Since we are talking about a movie set in the 60s, the theme may now look a bit similiar and the ending is not to everyone's liking (it was kept open ended for its less celebrated sequel). Nevertheless this movie sets the benchmark for horror films with the elements of devils and cults. Special mention to Mia Farrow for her amazing acting. Even if you have read the book, you are in for a surprise as she completely captivates you with her performance. The horror here is not the terror and shock, but is rather supplied by a mood of paranoia. Polonski manages to create something very errir out of the mundane. Concluding, if you have already watched quite a few horror movies, this one will likely feel a drab and overused. But watch it anyway. You can't find any more better novel adaptations than this!",

It not only revolves around the life of the protagonist but rather it creates space and allows other side characters to tell their own side of the story. This in turn creates room for breathing which otherwise would be just singular flow of the protagonist's life. And that, seperates the regular biography based films and Oscar worthy films such as this. A truly moving piece of art!",

   "Review": "This movie needs no introduction. Hell, it doesn't even actually require a review from me. Nevertheless, it just had to be included in here. The setting, the music the acting (oh the acting!), everything is just aweinspiring. Heath Ledger immortalized himself and his character for many years to come and set the bar extremely high (even moguls such as Jared Leto failed to reach that). This film acts itself out at the cross roads of poetry and old-school thriller (and that's a lot, considering this is actually a superhero movie!) The plot is amazingly intelligent and it's beauty lies in its underlying simplicity. Concuring at the modern school of literature of man versus self, is eactly what Nolan wants to convey, which Heath Ledger acted out to pure perfection. This movie lies amongst the highest rungs of the cinematic ladder (it still feels sureal that a superhero film getting such an accolade). A must watch!",

   "Review": "There was an option to mention this movie in The Dark Knight film review all together so as to reduce redundancy (I really hate having to have a seperate review about a sequel of a film that I already wrote about). But then again, this is Christopher Nolan we are talking about. And also to the fact that it would be completely unjust to Tom Hardy (who isn't talked much about for his acting as Bane). Making a sequel to the Dark Knight which set the the bar upto astronomical limits was tough enough. Even more difficult was the task of Tom Hardy who had to atleast match even half the mettle set by the legendary Heath Ledger. And I have to be honest here, he absolutely smashed that expectation and probably even more! Absolutely fantastic acing by him (Heath Ledger would be so proud!). The story, as we have come to expect from Nolan, was simply fabulous. Making a sequel to TDK and also ending the triology on a perfect ending would to too much asking for any director, but apparently not Nolan! Amazing story, amazing action sequence, fantastic acting (Tom Hardy once again, hats off) a complete thriller/action package!",

   "Review": "True story based movies is a very challenging endeavoure for directors. Especially those which do not involve murder mystery elements. The ones which involve heavy use of jargons to explain the plot is very difficult to mould, inorder for the viewers to understand. You can either make it interesting by employing the use of abnormal and witty characters (like The Wolf of Wall Street did) or you can go down the path of The Big Short- involving a first person narration albeit in a huglely entertaining manner! Based on events that led to the financial crisis of 2008, the director Adam McKay gives us a very simple yet a fun explaination of what transpired this downfall. He didn't shy away from using the financial jargon to deliver the story as it had been told, but at the same time also gives the explain-like-I-am-5 kind of understanding of each of those terms. Whether you are finance geek or not, this movie is bound to keep you entertained! Do give this a watch. It is definitely worth your while.",

Uncut Gems features the life of Howard Ratner, a jewish-american jeweler, who just can't get enough of gambling with other people's money, which inevidently leads to him getting into quite a pickle. The movie is so fast paced and filled with quite a few gambling jargons. But one just needs to hold on to the turbulant life of Howard Ratner to ride through the wave. However, this itself is a bit of a challenge, because Adam Sandler has showcased his character of that being a hyper-active New Yorker in a magnificant manner, one just can't help but pause the film in between, take a breather and resume again! The film's name is a revelation of how the story actually is and it feels almost poetic in sense. Simply, one of the best movie ever by Adam Sandler. A fantastic watch.",

   "Review": "The inclusion of this film here might perplex some of you. Was this film a box-office hit in the theaters? No. Was the story ground-breaking? No. Was the acting awe-inspiring? Yes, but not at the level that it might merit a review here. However, as a long time fan of the Wolverine, there is a bit of a bias when including it here (probably like the inclusion of The Watchmen). However, where this film stands out is how the directors managed to end the whole Wolverine Saga. What started out as a complete superhero-action film ends in a very mature and intelligent manner. In films where the protagonist holds the power of being immortal, it is really easy to show him/her off as a God-like personna, capable of pulling off awe-inspiring moments in the blink of an eye.  However, the directors showed the more humane side of Logan, finally made him more than just a weapon, and very gently, sailed him into the cold night. This transition was a refreshing breather from Marvels's regular comic-action superhero films. And this is why, Logan deserves a place in here. A beautiful ending to what was a string of generation inspiring films.",

   "Review": "A very few number of movies are able to define a whole generation of people as good as The Matrix does! The ground shattering idea of us living in a matrix may sound completely stupid and completely possible at the same time! Nothing has invigourated the youth of the 1990s generation as much as The Matrix did! The CGI (considering it was released almost two decades ago) seems almost magical! The Wachowski brothers not only experimented with a fantastic yet risky script, but also employed a a few amazing cinematographic techniques inoder to create this sci-fi as real as it possibly was for that time. Granted, the further sequels to the film did not exactly live up to their hype, but one should not take anything away from the first Matrix film. On the flip side, this movie may not be for everyone, as it generally caters to the casset-punk genre of the sci-fi which in itself is a very niche area. Nevertheless, do give it a watch tho. If not the setting or the CGIs, the story is bound to flip you over!",

   "Review": "A typical Tarantino film, this one. Has its share of bloodiness, but it all somehow gets negated with clever and witty dialogues or character! But take nothing away from it, as it all adds up to being a fully fledged entertainment! Tarantino in Inglorious Basterds tells the story of the fall of the Third Reich in his own way (which at times seem a bit far fetched, but probably intentionally to bring a dash of make-believe fantasy into the story-line). The plot remains relatively straight-forward, yet a few 'Tarantino-twists' and his wacky manner of cinematography makes it a lot of fun to watch! Christoph Waltz in his debut movie gives a gem of a performance! Overall, despite racking up quite a few body count in the film and if seen at a face-value has quite a few horrendous scenes, but it still manages to retain its lightheartedness to the core, thus leaving you surprisingly satisfied at the end!

   "Review": "When Pixar released Toy Story in 1999, it was a huge step towards making a full feature animated film. It defined a whole genre of films made simply for the kids and to let their imaginations run wild. When Wall - E was released, Pixar staked its claim, that animated films have the competancy to appeal to the older generation and has the power to potentially leave a solid mark in their heart. The whole setting is really quite depressing - humans being set-off into the vast darkness of the space, set into oblivion by their virtual screens while their robotic creations try charting a course back to normalancy. And that to be honest is quite a lot to take in for an animated film! However, by including the heart-warming story of Wall-E, the story-writers managed to not make this film too heavy but at the same time not let go of the underlying message.

The plot ending will leave quite a few hanging (but if you try looking it at the perspective of the protagonist - a teenage girl,  who see the world as a bed of roses, it would probably make more sense). The concept is actually quite unique and seeing the trailer should be enough to pique your interest. There's an underlying tone of creepiness that stays with you even after watching the movie. It certainly won't be enough to give you nightmares. But would probably site quitely in the corner of your mind like an unscratchable itch!

Boasting such a strong cast and directed by the makers of Inception and The Dark Knight (No not our beloved Nolan), it was bound to make a splash in the Hollywood. However, it crashed just as magnificantly as did the hype surrounding Keanu Reeves's Day the Earth Stood still. Mind you the story is actually pretty good and the ideas they experiment with certainly are very intriguing yet believable. However, if the quote - 'Too many cooks spoil the broth' could be sticked to one movie, this just might be it. At times, the direction seems to be everywhere, thus making it difficult for the viewer to get a grasp of what is happening. This similar technique is often employed by Nolan, but well.... he's not The Nolan for no reason! However, there also seems to be too much hate surrounding this, as the actors played their part with dedication. The plot is actually good (a bit over the top but can be excused for being a sci-fi movie) and will definitely provide enyertainment for a movie night out with friends.",

The director laysout all the components very clearly so there is no guessing as to how the ending would be. Nor are there any major twists and turns. But what makes this movie worth its salt, is the terrifying setting, the grotesquly created alien and the constant feel of having an imposter amongst us. All these components keeps us on the toes till the very end. A fun movie to watch with the ganag as not only is it very finely directed, but it also provides the blockbuster punch.",

The colour scheme is very indie and matches with the tone and the theme of the movie. The start is very predictable and one can see for miles where this might be leading. The ending however surprised me a bit (in a positive manner though) as Spike didn't break-off the movie as a love story but rather a sci-fi one. Hence it provided a little breathing room from all the mushy and heart-warming story lines that encompasses the majority of the screen time. Overall, I wished I had liked this movie a bit more.

Blackkklansman is the story of Ron Stallworth who with his partner managed to infiltrate the KKK and subsequently plan to bring it down. The plot is failry transparent as the viewer can see the climax comming from a mile. Where this movie shines is that Spike Lee manages to keep things lighthearted even when the udnerlying issue itself is a fairly serious topic. This allows room for a breather without which it might feel as another government made film on societal issue (which no offense to their message feel fairly boring).John David Washington gives a stellar performance. The major acting acolade here I would like to give would be the antagonist - who very naturally acted out the typical fascist red neck in the US in the 70s. The ending is a bit different from what might people expect as it would leave you hanging. However, it manages to bring us back to the point where Spike reminds us that even if the film was lighthearted, the issue still is very real. ",

   "Review": "You know it is going to a blockbuster all out entertainment film when you see the words - 'A film by Quenten Tarantino'. And this movie is exacatly like that. Maybe not to the level of other Tarantino works, but still pretty entertaining nonetheless! It revolves around the life of Rick Dalton - a superstar actor in the twilight of his career, and his stunt double. For most of the film, it showcases the strong ond between these two and how the activites of one affects the other, with Margot Robbie popping here and there (can't quite pin her role in the movie). It gives a deep focus into the Hollywood society and the works and at times almost feels like it is missing the 'Tarantino Punch'. That is untill the end of course that he makes comeback with a bang! Overall, it certainly does not lie in the shelves of Inglorious Basterds or Danjo Unchained, but since that bar itself is set so high, this film can be credited with a one time entertainment film and indeed does make a case for having a good time.",

   "Review": "Imagine the scene - it is a tuesday evening. All your friends are at work or have plans. You are alone at home and briefly find yourself in the sweet spot of not having anything planned for tomorrow, not having any deadlines to finish or any chores to do. Having already come off from a tirefull day at work, what do you do? Well, you sit down with a bowl of ice-cream and watch Lake Belle's In a world, is what you do! A story that won't completely blow you away and neither are the characters awe-inspiring. However that is exactly what this film aims to achieve. A nice simple plot, with light-hearted characters, set in a quiant town, with the backdrop of scene where things still haven't got that complicated as it is today! It creates a warm fuzzy feeling inside which might just teether at the edge of an overrun ruse for a few. However, for those dealing with the monday blues (heck, any blues), this movie will slow things down for you, wrap you up in its cozy arms, as the characters and the plot orchestrates a small slice of life that will leave you with a soft smile on your face.

   "Review": "It can be akined to walking on a tightrope to walk on for a director filming a movie which tackles a large number of social issues. If done wrong, you get a bland and tastless film which might seem as a propaganda film issued by the state! But if done right, you get Capernaum! It follows the events leading up to a possibly 12 year old boy Zain suing his parents for negligence. A fair bit warning, if you belong to those masses who get teary-eyed at seeing extreme poverty and hardship, this one is a tough to watch. Extremly raw, this film won't allow you to get some respite by having a few anecdotal episodes or even offer some shelter by having much of a background score (untill the end that is). I myself had to take a week, to watch this film completely. But once you do, this might just be the most powerful and moving piece of human resilience and keeping up the bravado during adversity. The film at the start very clearly discriminates between the protagonist and the antagonists, but by the end, those lines become blurry. You will start seeing the reason behind the actions of the 'bad people', their plight, their anguish. You'll start seeing the flaw in their logic and yet be in concurrence with their decisions. All in all, this one takes away the award for the best international film of this decade by a mile. A perfect screenshot of human emotion and logic, this one is one for the ages and beyond.",

   "Review": "This film is remarkable in the way that it does not have a definite storyline to follow - rather it is just a series of anecdotes strung together. But still, by the end you'll marvel at how effective and engaging it turned out to be! Sean Baker's The Florida Project gives an insight into the rarely shown part of USA - the poverty stricken family living in the budget hotels, and how they (especially the kids) manage to find joy in the smallest of things. The plot might seem a bit predictable as the characters themselves were on a self-destruction path. However, the noteworthy thing was that Barker managed to turn a predictable story line with almost no twists and turns and made it into a masterpice. The entier movie was seen through the perception of a six year old girl (which might help to justify the ending) and Baker very well complements that with vivid imagery and using bright colours. The entire 2 hours feels like watching it via an instagram filter! Hence in terms of cinematography it might just manage to sit at the table with The Grand Budapest Hotel. Overall, this is a decent enough light-hearted film. Some might characterize and a bit boring (justifiably dare I say!), but certainly no one can deny the cinematography, the use of colours, the unbelievable acting by a 6 six year old. And also, it feels really refreshing to see William Dafoe in role which does not range from the superhero film villain to a psychotic lighthouse keeper!",
