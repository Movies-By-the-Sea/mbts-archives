But still, by the end you'll marvel at how effective and engaging it turned out to be! Sean Baker's The Florida Project gives an insight into the rarely shown part of USA - the poverty stricken family living in the budget hotels, and how they (especially the kids) manage to find joy in the smallest of things. The plot might seem a bit predictable as the characters themselves were on a self-destruction path. However, the noteworthy thing was that Barker managed to turn a predictable story line with almost no twists and turns and made it into a masterpice. The entier movie was seen through the perception of a six year old girl (which might help to justify the ending) and Baker very well complements that with vivid imagery and using bright colours. The entire 2 hours feels like watching it via an instagram filter! Hence in terms of cinematography it might just manage to sit at the table with The Grand Budapest Hotel. Overall, this is a decent enough light-hearted film. Some might characterize and a bit boring (justifiably dare I say!), but certainly no one can deny the cinematography, the use of colours, the unbelievable acting by a 6 six year old. And also, it feels really refreshing to see William Dafoe in role which does not range from the superhero film villain to a psychotic lighthouse keeper!", 'Story': 2.8, 'Trailer': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwQ-NH1rRT4', 'Year': 2017}), ('-MQD37P0y3xjo32Bf5wT', {'Acting': 5.0, 'Director': 'TEST', 'Execution': 5.0, 'Genre1': 'TEST', 'Genre2': 'TEST', 'ID': 102, 'Image': 'https://storage.googleapis.com/movies-by-the-sea-ca0b5.appspot.com/vending%20machine.jpg', 'Instagram': 0, 'Lead': 'Adar Beck, Gemma Chan', 'Links': 'TEST.com', 'Name': 'TEST', 'Netflix': 1, 'Overall': 5.0, 'Poster': 'vending machine.jpg', 'Prime': 0, 'Profundity': 5.0, 'Review': 'THIS IS A TEST', 'Story':
