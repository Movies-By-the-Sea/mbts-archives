1,Mother!,"Arronofsky has very skillfully exposed how vulnerable we are when our privacy is exploited.  But this movie is much more than that. If you're a bit into christian mythology and enjoy having symbolism into your movies, this is the one! I strongly suggest you to read about the movie after it ends and read what it meant. I may go as far as to suggest that this movie lies in the bracket of movies like Fight Club; which received negative reviews upon it's release but after some time is regarded as the modern greats.",0,1,2017,Darren Aronofsky,"Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem",4,3.4,4.3,1.6,3.3,mother.jpg,psychopath,https://xmovies8.si/watch-mother-2017-1080p.27146-hd-online-free/watching.html?episode_id=104182&s=hserver,https://gdurl.com/d_rZ,https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XpICoc65uh0
2,Shape of Water,"I'm not generally into fantasy movies and especially if it is a love story. But this has completely blown my mind. The story is not that complicated; rather easy to decipher but the way it was executed, the acting is just exceptional.  Del Toro has portrayed the female emotions in a masterful manner and has set the benchmark for the fantasy genre. If you want to watch a heart-warming film which doesn't overdoses on the 'cheesy elements' (unlike other fantasies) and captivates you from start to end, this is the one for you.",0,0,2017,Guillermo del Toro,"Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon",4.7,4.2,3.9,1.8,3.65,shape of water.jpg,lighthearted,https://xmovies8.si/watch-the-shape-of-water-2017-1080p.60859-hd-online-free/watching.html?episode_id=103851&s=oserver,https://gdurl.com/yNat,https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XFYWazblaUA
3,Whiplash,"One of my favourite films ever.  One of those powerful and awe-inspiring movie that comes maybe just once a decade. The story line is simple. A boy wants to become a great drummer and his teacher helps him to become one. Simple right? But it didn't get the best academy award for motion picture for nothing. If it doesn't inspire you, nothing can. The cinematography (apart from the acting) is just stunning considering there was no scope for a grandious wide scope shots that generally get the praises. How Chazelle got to make academy winning film from such a simple script is just mind boggling. ",1,1,2014,Damien Chazelle,"Miles Teller, J.K.

4,2001: A space odessey,"This movie lies amongst the most influential movies of all times. Almost like the Interstellar of 1970s! The manner in which Kubrick has made this film taking into consideration what technologies he had to work with at that time is simply unbelievable. And as far as story goes, if you're not a fan of symbolism within the movie, I wouldn't particularly recommend this, as Kubrick has kept the movie open-ended and there are quite a few stretches where there would be no dialogue or background score and it would seem that the movie has come to a halt. But once you see the movie and research a bit about it,  you'll never believe what hit you, as the bigger picture this movie portrays answers one of the greatest intellectual questions of all time - where do we come from and where are we going?",1,0,1968,Stanley Kubrick,Kier Dullea,3.7,4.3,4.65,3.75,4.1,2001.jpg,thriller,https://xmovies8.si/watch-2001-a-space-odyssey-1968-1080p.94320-hd-online-free/watching.html?episode_id=219&s=ptserver,https://gdurl.com/xReo,https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UgGCScAV7qU
5,Midsommar,"One of the most daring films by Ari Aster wherein he experimented wit the idea of a daytime horror film which I should say he executed to perfection. Mind you watching it first time would fill you with complete disgust and the amount of gore in it is insane. But it is one of those gores for which you would develop appreciation for as you give it a long thought. All the elements in the film adds to the suspense and are not there just for the 'horror'.

6,A Clockwork Orange,"The best movie by Stanley Kubrick in my opinion. It ranks amongst one of the best revenge-based-movies ever! And by that, I don't mean to only point towards the plot, but also towards the way it was executed. It is more of a stylistic movie than your regular ones. The way the dialogoues are delivered isn't just plain old english but rather seems as if poetry is rolling off from actors mouth. the cinematography is phenomenal and it reaches just the perfect amount of abstractness - not too much to be considered crazy and not too little to be seen as a long shot. Trust me, if you want to have a feel of what Kubrick represents, this is the movie that you should be watching.",1,0,1971,Stanley Kubrick,Malcom McDowell,4.2,4.4,4.1,2.4,3.8,clockwork orange.png,psychopath,https://xmovies8.si/watch-a-clockwork-orange-1971-1080p.17615-hd-online-free/watching.html?episode_id=38059&s=ptserver,https://gdurl.com/o5Kv,https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SPRzm8ibDQ8
7,Requime for a Dream,"Hands down the best film by Aronofsky. The story line is very very simple. Some kids are doing drugs and how their lives spiral down because of it. But man it shows more than that! It represents how a person longs for love, the feeling of being connected and the need for being recognized. Be warned, it is a dark movie and won't leave you with a happy face. Aronofsky is know to mess with deepest of human desires and this movie is no exception. It really is a gut wrenching movie and shouldn't be watched while you are going through the motions in your life as this movie definitely won't help your case.

8,Perfect Blue,"Satoshi Kon's movies often deals with the blurring of lines between imagination and reality and no movie other than this executes it to perfection than perfect blue. No wonder Aronofsky took inspiration from this movie to shoot some of the scenes in Requime for a dream to showcase a mentally broken character. A true psycho thriller in making. Make sure to keep a keen eye on the story as it takes a lot of twists and turns. And also one more thing, unlike some of the anime movies out there, this one is very dark showing gratuitous rape scenes, violent and gore murders. It isn't very easy on the eyes. But make no mistake as all these elemnents aren't without a cause and definitely leads upto the climax.

9,Birdman,"In terms of cinematography, this movie lies amongst the very best. The directors have tried to do this as a single shot movie, which I should say the least is done to perfection! These kind of movies are either a hit or miss. If you do it perfectly, it makes the movie engaging and absorbing, but if you do even a slight mistake, it leaves a foul taste in mouth. So when I say it is the best single-shot movie out there, I mean it! As far as the story is concerned, it has quite a contemporaray take, as in there isn't a proper plot or climax or anything, but still, the way it has been executed and that it has one an oscar says lot about it! I can go on and on but I leave it to you guys to see this masterpiece for yourself and don't worry, it is so much worth your time!",0,0,2014,Alejandro Inarritu,"Michael Keaton, Emma Stones",4.5,3.2,4.6,3.5,3.95,birdman.jpg,drama,https://xmovies8.si/watch-birdman-or-1080p.36554-hd-online-free/watching.html,https://gdurl.com/ZoPG,https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/egYzOALlYyU
10,Parasite,"One of the very few movies out there who are able to cover the complete spectrum of human emotions - from laughter, happiness to sadness and sorrow to even horror and suspense! The film has an amazing storyline which takes twists and turns at the right places so that it retains the viewer's interest. It is that kind of movie where you wouldn't want to leave your sear for even a one second! And it follows the perfect graph of story telling too! Starts with the right pace, picks up a bit of speed to pique interest, then slows down a bit to let you register it and when you think nothing exciting would happen, it bulldozes you with an amazing climax!

11,Blood Diamond,"How this movie remains so underrated is something I might never understand! Not the very best of Leo but still quite spactacular! Of course it lacks the beauty that is required to name itself amongst the brackets of Revenanat but the storyline itself is so engaing that it earns it spot in my blog. If you want to watch a movie for which you don't have to analyse much but still at the same time should be interesting enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, this is the one for you. Let's just say if you guys liked watching Narcos - which was based on a true story but the directors managed NOT to make it like a documentary, you would 110% enjoy it.

12,Inception,"I guess this movie doesn't require much of a review as I'm sure by the word of mouth or via the general rave this movie got speaks volumes in itself. But still if looked at it via a filmaker's PoV, it is a masterpiece. It has been strongly suggested that Nolan got the inspiation for it from the Satoshi Kon's Paparika. But although having the advantage of having an animeic medium for story telling, it couldn't get the polt across as easily as the directors would've wanted. But Nolan has executed it to perfection! (Although I'm sure a majority would've had to see the movie twice or thrice to get a grip on it!). It is now only can one marvel at the ease with which the scenes are shown so as to get more than a faint idea of what's going on!",0,1,2010,Christopher Nolan,Leonardo DiCaprio,3.3,4.3,4.5,1.7,3.45,inception.jpg,thriller,https://xmovies8.si/watch-inception-2010-1080p.12467-hd-online-free/watching.html?episode_id=12135&s=oserver,https://gdurl.com/K0eX,https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8hP9D6kZseM
13,Shutter Island,"This is that movie which you should watch on a dark rainy night with a big bowl of popcorn and a warm blanket; in short, a perfect blockbuster! The script is excellent and unlike many suspense movies, the climax lives up (exceede, dare I might say!) to the buildup. It would keep you guessing, on the toes and would venture out to just near the edge of insanity where even the familiarity of the narrator or the protagonist wouldn't give you the comfort of control over what's going on! But wait! This wouldn't kill your interest. The movie doesn't over-milk the thriller essence but rather allows one to get to terms with it slowly and surely. I say, this is one of the best thriller-suspens emovies out there and definitely worth your time!",0,1,2010,Martin Scorsese,Leonardo DiCaprio,3.1,3.8,3.1,1.5,2.95,shutter island.jpg,thriller,https://xmovies8.si/watch-shutter-island-2010-1080p-hd-online-free/watching.html?episode_id=12357&s=hserver,https://gdurl.com/7fHE,https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5iaYLCiq5RM
14,The Shawshank Redemption,"""Hope is a good a good thing, maybe the best of things. And good thing never dies."" There's nothing left to say about this movie as there are thousands and thousands of webpages online which have disected the movie to it's purest elements. So it comes as no surprise when it was given the title of being a US national Treasure! Once again - a really simple concept. Man goes to Jail and tries to escape it; a mark of a truly great film. But the way the dynamics are portrayed between the protagonists, his friends, the Warden is so exceptional that it trancends the feeling of watching a movie. You feel yourself become one of the prisoners of Shawshank itself; aided by the spectacular narration of Morgan Freeman. I won't say more about this - just that this is one of those movies which you have and have to watch before you die.",1,1,1994,Frank Darabont,Tim Robbins,3.4,4.8,4.3,4.7,4.3,shawshank.jpg,inspirational,https://xmovies8.is/the-shawshank-redemption-stream-66877.html,https://gdurl.com/5LE0,https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SuwD1NDEVJ8
15,Forrest Gump,"Probably the most complete movie out there. It is one of those few films which encompases all the emotions into one 'reel' - comedy,adventure,meloncholy,romance, you name it! The best thing that I like about this movie is that it does not have a definite story path. There's no motive or reason to why the protaginist is behaving in such manner. But that's what makes it such a fun to watch as we go on a hilarious yet heart warming journey with Forrest Gump. Apart from that, it has a lot of easter eggs spread evenly which openly mocks some of the infamous moments of the 60s. Keep an eye out for them! I would say this is one of the few light hearted movies which you should definitely watch if you crave something funny yet warm movie.",0,1,1994,Robert Zemeckis,Tom Hanks,4.3,4.4,3.8,4.3,4.2,forrest gump.jpg,lighthearted,https://xmovies8.si/watch-forrest-gump-1994-1080p.68908-hd-online-free/watching.html?episode_id=12540&s=hserver,https://gdurl.com/vRtX,https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bLvqoHBptjg
16,Interstellar,"Directing movies related to space is always tricky. You either need to have a jaw dropping storry line like 2001, or have stunning visuals like Graavity did. But Interstellar masterfully combines both and executes it to perfection. Like trademark of many of Nolan's movies, you will have to watch it twice or thrice to properly understand what actually is happening! (especially the climax).All the elements in this film add on to the story and have a well defined role to play. The reasoning that Nolan provides for each twist and turns are logical and believable. And of course, the amazing background score by Hans Zimmer enhances the feel of the movie!",0,1,2014,Christopher Nolan,Matthew McConaughey,3.3,4.3,4.5,1.8,3.45,interstellar.jpg,thriller,https://xmovies8.si/watch-interstellar-2014-1080p.56844-hd-online-free/watching.html?episode_id=5187&s=hserver,https://gdurl.com/fRaR,https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zSWdZVtXT7E
17,The wolf of wall street,"This is a movie which appeals to a very specific set of people. A fairly long movie with a few jargons related to finance (but easy to understand thanks to the narration provided inbetween), but if you give it a little try, this movie is a masterclass! The acting by Leo is just fantastic and what makes you appreciate that sentiment more is the fact that how many emotions he had to portray in the film! From euphoria to horror to cunningness to just plain stupidity even! And the acting itself says a lot about the storyline where you wouldn't exactly empathise or relate (unless you're a trader on Wall Street itself!) but rather accept and like him as a shrewd and fun-loving person! Overall, a hugely entertaining movie!",1,1,2013,Martin Scorsese,Leonardo DiCaprio,3.9,3.8,3.4,1.1,3.1,wolf of wallstreet.png,true-story,https://xmovies8.is/the-wolf-of-wall-street-stream-72130.html,https://gdurl.com/wCS3,https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iszwuX1AK6A
18,Black Swan,"There's something about those movies which focuses on the protagonist who tries to reach perfection. Either it goes astray and leave a dull taste behind, or those, which just nails it like Whiplash did. Balck Swan is the later. A ballerina's  quest to be the best of herself and slowly in the way losing her mind to her devotion.  Nothing more can be said about the acting by Natalie Portman (who recieved an oscar for it) and the intelligent cinematography which very skillfully the blurring of reality of our protagonist.

19,Joker,"Ah, finally we get to the most reprised role of all - the Joker! Todd Philips has portrayed his joker as the mentally unstable one who gradually finds solace within madness and eventually becomes a psycopath (not explicitely shown in the movie) but one can guess as this definitely isn't the anarchist that Nolan portrayed. So don't watch this film with the expectation of a criminal mastermind of a joker or else you would be disappointed. But rather watch it for the amazing cinematography, the awe-inspiring acting, the perfect dark setting. The storyline isn't much groundbreaking but for showing the origins of joker, it can't get better than this. One can only hope to see the deious schemes that the Joker is associated with would become evident with the upcoming movies but as a base for that, this definitely hits the home run!",0,0,2019,Todd Philips,Joaquin Pheonix,4.8,2.4,3.7,1.4,3,joker.png,psychopath,https://xmovies8.si/watch-joker-2019-1080p.25156-hd-online-free/watching.html?episode_id=122042&s=hserver,https://gdurl.com/z3Or,https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zAGVQLHvwOY
20,Fight Club,"One of the most controversial movie out there! Upon it's release, it recieved many neagtive review such that it was considered a flop at the box office. It was only 6-7 years later that people can to realize how powerful it actually is! Granted, at the strat, it feels very abstract, the dialogue delivery isn't very staright forward and you sometimes feel lost. But the twist that it provides at the end set the basis of many psycological films for years to come! It maintains a very fine speed of story so you won't feel bored at any time.

Hirokazu Koreeda's Palme d'Or winning Japanese ""family"" drama continuously asks this question and in twisted but inherently human fashion , in the final quarter of the film puts forward its own take on those philosophical questions . Through candidly beautiful cinematography , Shoplifters tells its simple yet cathartic story , showing us around lives of chaos albeit through the lens of calmness , never getting heavy for any kind of viewer .

No movie portrays this emotion as powerfully and in it's purest form by Three Billboards. A mom is out for justice for her daughter who was brutally raped and left for dead. Based on a true story, it shows complex character dynamics as the protagonist walks the thin line between retribution and precise justice. Now, let me warn you, this movie does not provide closure, so you fill a bit wanting at the end.

The template might seem a bit uncommon what differentiates it from the rest is the beautiful use of sybolism within the movie coupled with some of the best acting you can find theese days! The film very craftfully uses wide angle scenes to give a feel of looking at a portrait rather than a movie. An excellent dramatic storyline with a bit dark, yet beautiful ending.

28,The Grand Budapest Hotel,"Set in the turbulent times of early 20th century in the make-believe Republic of Zubrowka features the tintin-esque story of a concierge M. Gustave and his protege Zero who have been falsely accused of murder. It's a simple concept, nothing too extravagent. But what makes this such a breathtaking movie is that it does not have a story; rather has a fairy tale! Wes Anderson has purposefully directed it in a square frame with zero use of CGI to make it as fantastical as possible. Each frame looks like something out of a painter's canvas and this attributes to such a fresh breather to what we are usually accustomed to see! If you aren't impressed by the eye-candy of cinematography or the impeccable setting or the magnificent background score, fret not!

29,The Truman Show,This movie looks like an episode of Black Mirror which has been diluted to the level of Forrest Gump and add a dash of the Matrix to it! Maybe not that much but you get the gist! It literally revolves around the life of Truman Burbank who unbeknown to him is actually a movie set. It is an incredible concept and the camera angles are very skilfully adjusted to continue to give us the feel of watching a TV show while at the same time look at this made-up world from a first person perspective.

30,The Green Book,"The 2018 Academy award winner is based on the true story of Dr. Don Shirley and his driver Frank who traverse the southern parts of the USA in 1962, at a time when blacks were treated as inferior beings. It showcases the hardships that Dr. Shirley had to undergo and the cathartic journey of Frank - from a racist bigot to a culurally refined man. I felt the cathartic journey was rushed upon, but apart from that, is a fabulous movie. There's nothing defining about this movie and may have often gone past the eye unnoticed.

The movie showcases his yearning for youth, power, respect and of course beauty which is actuated by his daughter's 17 year old best friend; who he lusts for. Note this is in no way a Lolita-esque senario but rather of how a man having such a low self esteem and hatered for himself starts dreaming again and gets free form years of emotional paralysis. It plays with conundrum of a man having impure thoughts even tho he knows are morally wrong and yet can't help it as he's been wired like that.

It is about Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski who gets mistaken for a billionaire with the same name and seeks restitution for his stolen rug. It gives you a foray into how the Coen Brothers direct thier movies - a laid back chill attitude with a sparkle of hillariousness here and there. There's a bit of mystery element and is laid with wonderfully funny sequences. It's 2 hours of pure joy after which you can't help but love 'The Dude' and his pals. It feels quite refreshing to watch this one while at the same time gives an insight into the wonderful execution of the Coen brothers which I'll leave it up to you to see for yourself.,1,0,1998,Coen Brothers,"Jeff Bridges, John Goodman",2.9,2.9,3.4,1.4,2.65,lebowski.jpg,lighthearted,https://xmovies8.si/watch-the-big-lebowski-1998-1080p.19129-hd-online-free/watching.html?episode_id=14481&s=hserver,https://gdurl.com/toAz,https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mCkix5EJSnE

But oh man have I ever not regretted that decision! It is thoroughly charming, gently comic; this is the story of a boy and a girl whose body get's exchanged and their tale of trying to meet each other. But fate has other plans. It is wonderfully executed. Each scene comes across as something out of an art gallery! The fact that it is the highest grossing anime film yet is attributed to impeccable story writing which leaves you emotionally satisfied. A bit of a mindbender too which gives the viewer a breather from the romance in it. When the tipping point in story comes, it will bowl you over (like you've been struck by a meteor!) and by the end, it is garunteed to leave a smile on your face and tears in your eyes.

34,The Handmaiden,"I would like to catagorise this movie amongst the realms of 'close but no cigar'. Started of well, provided an amazing turn in the middle and was on it's way to achieve a masterclass climax. The setting is done like nothing ever seen before! The perfect mix of 17th century old Japan with roots to the British empire. There's a generous amount of nudity and eroticism within the movie (so yeah definitely not a family movie!). The errie soundtrack with an almost perfect storyline shoots this almost to the heights of Parasite (another masterpiece from the Korean Cinema). The movie creates the perfect sense of suspense and had it not been for a bit predictable ending (coupled with some unnecessarily long erotic sequences) this movie would've been on a whole different level. But it wasn't selected for the Palme D'Or for nothing! The movie will keep you in a hold for a majority of time, so if you want to watch a thriller suspense with backdrop like that of The Favourite, this one should just do it.",0,0,2016,Park Chan-wook,Min-hee Kim,2.4,3.5,3.7,1.2,2.78,handmaiden.jpg,international,https://xmovies8.si/watch-the-handmaid-2016-1080p-hd-online-free/watching.html?episode_id=44176&s=oserver,https://gdurl.com/2MbN,https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/whldChqCsYk
35,"I, Tonya","A powerhouse of a film. The reason this movie went under the radar of many despite the star power of Margot Robbie would be because of potentially portraying Tonya Harding, a controversial figure herself in a light which many might not agree with. But simply no one can take away the absolute peach of acting by Margot. Looking back at this movie, no one comes to mind who could better project a strong, rough red neck who despite having her life riddled with abuse continue to keep up her bravado and march on. The scene where she tries to put a smile on her face despite having an immense desire to cry is enough to make Joaquin Pheonix proud! That is the level of acting we are talking. If you know the actual controversy surrounding Tonya Harding, this movie won't provide much of an insight, but if not, this seems like a good place to dip your feet into one of the shocking moments of figure skating.",0,0,2018,Craig Gillespie,"Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan",3.9,2.4,2.3,1.5,2.52,tonya.jpg,true-story,https://xmovies8.si/watch-i-tonya-2017-1080p.14613-hd-online-free/watching.html,https://gdurl.com/aQ-E,https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zjDZwOJlxNE
36,Mulholland Drive,"What an acid trip of a movie this is! As it is typical of David Lynch's movies the story starts without any fuss or giving any time to settle and often relies on the viewer to piece ones and twos together rather than explain it explicitly. But they manner the script completely flips by the end seems almost there are two stories going on in the movie! It shows how easy it is to loose your mind in the challenging environment of hollywood. It is the stuff dreams and dillusion are made of and is the movie which we are trying to decipher to this date even! I would like to say here that Lynch tried to pull off what Kubrick did with 2001; leving the story open-ended. Although he did not reach the same level as Kubrick's masterpiece did in that manner, I would still say, he did one hell of a job. I strongly suggest people to read more about it's ending once you've seen it as it definitely ain't easy to get it all in one go.

37,Moonrise Kingdom,"Ah, Wes Anderson and his warm and poignant movies full of his idiosyncratic views are always a fun to watch. As his trademark this movie too is something out of a child's story book. There are wide angle shots with almost no sudden cuts, often ridiculous use of CGI (knowingly so as to emphasise the feel of watching a fantasy story unfold!) with the characters being innocent and whimsical. The movie starts with a shade of The Blue Lagoon to it's tail and feels a bit cheeky. But it wears you down slowly to the point that you would feel dissapointed that it ends as it offers an escape from your regular movies. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is at the level of The Grand Budapest Hotel (that was one-in-a-million movie) but you could certainly see how this movie proved to be the penultimate step towards horning his cinematic skills for THAT masterpiece.

As with his previous films, Adaptation and The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I had the uneasy feeling that one single idea was being extruded to an excessive length, but this movie's crazy emotional intensity and ambition really punched my lights out. For his directorial debut, the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has outdone himself, for good. Truly a master piece, with motifs hidden in dialogues that blow your mind, yet seem so familiar.

39,12 Angry Men,"It feels almost sureal that a movie which was directed almost 50 years ago about a court room drama still resonates as on of the finest films of the 20th century. It features how 12 jurors are tasked with giving the final verdict on whether a boy is guilty or not after looking at the evidence. The case seema fairly straight forward but one of them feels that they aren't looking at it closely. What follows is his efforts to look at the case objectively and eventually convinece the other 11 men the other way around. The filming takes completely in one room which makes it very hard for the director to not make the film feel static or even induce a feeling of claustrophobia within the viewers. Each of 12 men were associated with a distinct traight who preformed to the level that it makes the movie feel not just a discussion with 12 average Joes even though their background was such! Overall, if you can get over the fact that it's a BnW film, I suggest you do give it a watch. On other hand, even if you aren't, do watch it.

40,The Lighthouse,"Set in the early 20th century, this is a movie of two men who are stuck at a lighthouse island and their gradual descent into madness. Robert Eggers very clearly flexes his impeccable sense of direction here. It creates an eerie sense of unsettling while keeping you drawn to the fantastic setting. What boosts this prospect is that the movie is shot in square frame and is in BnW. As all greate psychological thrillers, this too has a quite bit of symbolism which like I suggest in my previous reviews encourage you to read more about the movie after it ends to actually feel the message that the story writer wanted to send across. But what truely makes this a masterpiece is the oscar worthy acting by both Williem Defoe and Robert Pattinson (who may have have proved his mettle as an actor with this movie). They could easily have won an oscar (Defoe should've gotten for supporting actor imo) had it not been for a certain Joker. Overall this is powerfull watch which would dazzle you with it's acting, setting and symbolism rather than the story itself.

Creepy side characters - the twins, naked old lady, check. And the acting - oh man, I don't think this movie would've got even half the recognition it gets had it not been the terrific acting by Jack Nicolson. The perfect level of insanity has been displayed by Nicolson with emphasis on each and every muscles of the face! The bar scene is enough to school some of the greats today! The Shining has set the benchmark for all psychological thrillers to come. But if you really want to take a feel of the story, I suggest you read the book (the film no doubt stands strong in it's own rights but still couldn't capture the true insanity that Jack Torrence faced as well as the book did).

I myself felt that Zack Snyder has done 100% justice to this movie by incorporating each and every element that's there in the comic and brought it to the movie. But that's what I felt prevented it from reaching the heights the movie was supposed to with such a spectacular story as one simply can't bring out the beauty that the comic exudes with its charm onto a screen. But Snyder gets full credits for it's execution. This movie may not have the best ratings but I've still included it here as a homage to the actual Watchmen comic book which was far ahead of it's time and is quite accurately regarded as the greatest comic ever written.

This is a belarussian film set in the 1980s where an aspiring DJ plans to go to US to escape her boring routine and do something she actually likes. But a small typo in her visa application creates problems and she has to go some distance (literally!) to ensure that everything functions smoothly. A pretty straight-forward plot. But what makes this an exquisite watch is that the director has absolutely nailed in showcasing the hoplessness and desperation in one's eyes when he/she senses an oportunity of a better life which seems to slipping from their grasp. As a foreign viewer, it totally bowls you over giving insight into the daily lives of the smaller towns in the eastern block of Europe. And credit where it is deserved- the acting by the lead actress is phenomenal and she totally encapsules what the director wanted to showcase. Despite this tremendous performance, it still surprises me why is she so unknown! But all in all this is a must watch film and I don't throw that word around lightly!

Accompanying her are her cousin and his accquiantance. Not your essential road-trip movie, but it provides a youthful perspective to matters. The beauty here lies more in the complex dynamics between the 3 rather than the story itself. But the main selling point for me here is the magnificant cinematography- use of soft yet vivid colours, shooting in tight angles so as to just capture the essence, the 4:3 aspect ratio really adds to the setting. Also, the film does not feature any pan shots and has very few instances of having a background score- thus giving it a realistic feel.

51,1917,"A tour-de-force of a film this is! Making a war film always requires a humongous budget because of the sheer size, special effects and a pelothra of side actors. Not to mention the amount of time and work it must take to make it as realistic as possible. And 1917 comes as close to realism as any war movie possibly can! It portrays the life in the trenches during WW1 and the risks and hazards that the soldier must undertake. It has been made as a single shot movie (and thus commands greater respect as to how could Sam mendes possible shoot scenes in such narrow trenches!) The film also has beautiful instances of humanity and takes necessary pauses whereever required. The detailing is immaculate and really transports you to that erra and the cinematography makes you resonates with what the soldiers are feeling mentally. This is a must watch movie for the war-movie enthusiats out there!",0,0,2020,Sam Mendes,"George MacKay, Dean-Charles Chapman",3.3,3.7,4.4,2.3,3.42,1917.jpg,true-story,https://xmovies8.si/watch-1917-2019-1080p.13595-hd-online-free/watching.html,https://gdurl.com/D5I4,https://www.youtube.com/embed/YqNYrYUiMfg
52,Get Out,"The biggest mindbender of a movie on 2017 (possibly the decade?). You will never anticipate the ending in a million years! It is that good! The movie starts creating a sense of errieness and continuously gives off unsettling vibes. In the majority of the movie everyone's smilling but there's a constant sense of impending doom. The acting by Daniel Kaayula is just spectacular and at no point would you ever want to leave your seat! What makes this such a spectacular psychological horror is that this movie won't mess around with your brain. The clues are wide open for all to see. The thrill here would rather be the greater picture that these clues point to. It invovles Chris who has been invited to he girlfirend's parent's house for a party but slowly discovers there's a far sinister purpose to his visit. Even if you are a fan of horror/thriller or not, this is a must watch!",1,0,2017,Jordan Peel,"Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams",3.4,3.9,2.4,1.7,3,get out.jpg,psychopath,https://xmovies8.si/watch-get-out-2017-1080p-hd-online-free/watching.html,https://gdurl.com/hoNS,https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHEl7Pji0f8
